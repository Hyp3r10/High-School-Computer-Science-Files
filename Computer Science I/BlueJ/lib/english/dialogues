editor-crashed
It seems that BlueJ crashed while writing this class
to disk last time. The source code may be missing or 
incomplete. There should be a backup of this class 
in the project folder. If this class seems damaged,
   1 - quit BlueJ
   2 - backup your project folder (just in case)
   3 - look into the project folder for a backup of
       this java file. Rename it to the original
       file name (with a '.java' suffix)

doctool-error
Javadoc reported an error. It could be that there is a
syntax error in one of the files you tried to generate
a documentation for. It could also be that the JDK
documentation URL specified in the preferences is incorrect.

open-non-bluej-already-bluej
The directory you have selected is already
a BlueJ project.

open-non-bluej-no-java
No Java source files were
found in this directory.

open-non-bluej-invalid
You have indicated you wish to open this
directory as a BlueJ project, however a file
has been found with a package statement that
is incompatible with the current directory
structure. (For example, if the Java class
Shape has a package line of com.aa, then the
file Shape.java must be in a directory aa
which is itself in a directory com. This com
directory in turn must be in another directory
which is the directory you should point BlueJ
to when attempting to open it).

import-into-current

Do you want to import into the current package
or would you like to create a new project and
import into that?
Current
New Project
Cancel

package-name-invalid
You have changed the package statement
to a package which does not exist in this project.
If you wish to move this class to another
package you must create the destination
package first. The package statement has been
reverted back to its original form.

package-name-clash
You have changed the package statement to 
a package that already has a class or package
of this name. If the class is moved, the
existing class or package would be overwritten,
so the package statement has been reverted
back to its original form.

package-name-changed
You have changed the package statement which
tells Java the package this class is in. Do you
want to move this class to the indicated package
or do you want to leave the class where it is
(the package statement will be reverted back to
its original form)?

error-create-vm
BlueJ was unable to create a virtual machine (VM) to execute projects.
This is a serious problem - you will not be able to create objects 
or execute methods without solving it. Often this is caused by overly
restrictive firewall settings.
Please see <http://www.bluej.org/help/faq.html#socket-exc> for more
information.

project-is-readonly
The project being opened is read-only:
:
    $
:
To use this project, you will first need to choose a new location to
save it to.

project-is-virtualized
The project you are opening is being virtualized by Windows. This 
usually happens when the project is stored somewhere in the 
"Program Files" directory. 
When a project is being virtualized by Windows you will get errors 
when trying to create objects and invoke methods.
To use this project, you should move the project to a different
location. This can be accomplished by choosing "save as" from 
the Project menu after closing this dialog.

could-not-write-shell-file
Execution failed because the project directory is not writable.
To create objects or execute methods, we must be able to write
to the project directory. Make sure your project is on a writable 
file system (not a CD!) and that you have write permission in
the project directory and all files in it.

jar-output-dir-exists
The output directory for the archive being extracted already
exists. You must remove the existing directory before you can
extract the archive.

jar-output-no-write
The output directory cannot be created. Make sure you copy the 
archive to a writable folder first.

jar-extraction-error
An error occurred in extracting the archive contents. The debug
log may contain more information.

file-save-error-before-compile
One or more files could not be saved, so compilation was cancelled.

generic-file-save-error
An error was encountered when trying to save a file.

empty-assertion-text
You have not entered an expected result for this method call.
Without this result, your test is incomplete, and your test class will
not compile. Are you sure you want to continue without entering
a result value?

team-update-first
There have been changes made to files in the repository, but the files
have been deleted in your working copy. This is a conflict. Before you can
do a commit, you need to perform an update, which will restore the
repository versions. The following files are affected:

team-resolve-conflicts-delete
There are conflicts with some files, which have been modified in the
repository as well as in your working copy. You need to delete your versions
of the following files and then perform an update in order to resolve the
conflict:

team-resolve-merge-conflicts
During a previous update, there were merge conflicts in some files. You need
to edit the following files and resolve the conflicts before you can perform
a commit:

team-unresolved-conflicts
There are unresolved conflicts with the following files. You will
have to delete the files locally to resolve the conflict:

team-uptodate-failed
Your local copy is out of date. Update from repository
before committing your local changes.

team-cant-connect
Cannot connect to the server. Check that server
address is correct in the Team Settings.

team-project-exists
The project already exists on the server. Maybe you 
want to use Checkout, to check out the existing project
or rename your project and commit again.

team-cant-find-path
The path cannot be found on the server. This might be because
the specified group or project doesn't exist on the server.
Check that these are correct in the Team Settings, and that 
they exist on the server.

team-cant-find-module
Project not in repository. A project must be shared (put 
in the repository) before you can check it out.

team-cant-find-repository
