README - <bluej-home>/lib/<language>/templates/newclass/README
--------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains class templates for BlueJ.

These class templates appear as choices in the "New Class" dialogue in the
BlueJ environment.


Changing templates
------------------
Templates can easily be changed by editing these files.


Adding new templates
--------------------
To add a template, create a new file in this directory with a ".tmpl"
suffix (for example "mainclass.tmpl").

Names for applets, interfaces, abstract, unittest, enum or midlet classes should start with 
"appletj", "interface", "abstract", "unittest", "enum" or "midlet" respectively. Everything else
will be treated as a standard class.

By default, this template will be listed in the New Class dialogue at the
end of the selection list with the base of its filename ("mainclass").

The name appearing in the dialogue may be defined by defining a property
"pkgmgr.newClass.<template-name>" in the labels file (the labels file
is at <bluej-home>/lib/<language>/labels). For example, defining

   pkgmgr.newClass.mainclass=Class with Main

will result in "Class with Main" appearing in the dialogue for our new 
choice.

The position in the list may be specified by adding this new template to
the list specified in the "bluej.classTemplates" property in the BlueJ
definitions file (<bluej-home>/lib/bluej.defs). All templates listed here
will appear in the specified order, other templates in this directory will
be appended to the list in random order.
