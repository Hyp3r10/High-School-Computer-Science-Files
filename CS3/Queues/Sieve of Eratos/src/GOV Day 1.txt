Federal is Capital intensive -- mostly national defense (technology) 
	-biggest expense is shifting money around (ex: social security)
State and local is very labor intensive -- Police, Fire, Teaching, etc. 
	
Why study State and Local government? 
	1. Polotics and public polocies are unavoidable
	2. State and local governments are important
	3. Different state and local governments do things differently
		-Institutions
		-Political Culture and behavior
			*Characteristics of the people who live in the states
		-Public Polocies
	4. Variation + Many cases -> Ability to test hypothesis
